		In 2007 Valve released their family friendly puzzle-game <i>Portal</i> to the masses as part of their <i>Orange Box Collection</i>. The game was met with critical acclaim and even to this day, almost eighteen years later, it remains one of their most popular and beloved titles. The game received its sequel <i>Portal 2</i> in 2011, which was met with even greater success than its predecessor. The franchise then laid dormant for another eleven years, before receiving a full graphical update in 2022 with the release of <i>Portal with RTX</i>, which is a free DLC for the original <i>Portal</i> game. 
		<br><br>
		This free update features upgraded player models, new and improved textures, as well as the implementation of ray tracing, to help revitalize the game and make it stand on its own when comparing it to modern standards.
		<br><br>
		Whether you’re reliving this amazing and groundbreaking puzzle game or getting ready to experience it for the very first time, <i>Portal with RTX</i> is without a doubt <i>THE</i> definitive way to experience Valve’s timeless classic. So sit back, enjoy and get ready to lose yourself in Aperture Science’s incredible and complex laboratory chambers.
