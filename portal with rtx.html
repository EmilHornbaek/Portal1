	<h3>PORTAL Like You've Never Experienced It Before</h3>
	<br><br>
	<p2>		
	Get ready to experience <i>Portal</i> in a way you have NEVER seen it before. With DLSS 3 and the enabling of real time ray tracing, <i>Portal with RTX</i> lets you journey through <i>Aperture Science</i> laboratories in a new and exciting way, with gorgeous visuals that even gives modern AAA-titles a run for their money. Taking full advantage of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 30 or 40 series GPUs, the official <i>Portal with RTX</i> mod for <i>Valve’s</i> original 2007 standout release presents the classic first-person puzzle game in a beautiful way, features ray tracing and updated assets, which gives the game a complete overhaul.
		<br><br>
	<i>Portal with GTX</i> allows the game to run in gorgeous 4k resolution, giving you the best visuals the market has to offer and with DLLS 3’s anti-aliasing allows you to experience the classic game in way above 60FPS. Once you’ve played <i>Portal</i> like this, it’ll make you question if you’ve ever truly played <i>Portal</i> at all.
		<br>
	One thing is for certain. You will never look back.

	<h3>The Magic of Ray tracing</h3>
	<br><br>
	<p2>		
	That all sounds great, but what exactly IS ray tracing? Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to make images look incredibly realistic by mimicking how light works in the real world. Imagine light traveling in straight lines from a light source, like the sun or a lamp, and hitting objects in a scene. These light rays bounce off surfaces, refract through transparent materials like glass, or even get absorbed by dark objects. Ray tracing follows these light rays from the camera’s viewpoint backward through the scene to calculate how the light would interact with everything it touches.
		<br><br>
	By doing this, ray tracing creates lifelike reflections, shadows, and lighting effects that are very close to what we see in real life. For example, it can make a shiny surface reflect nearby objects, or show how a glass of water bends light as it passes through. It also helps in making shadows look softer and more natural.
		<br><br>
	Because ray tracing simulates light’s behavior in such detail, it produces stunning images, but it’s also very demanding for computers. This is why it’s often used in movies or high-end video games, where creating the most realistic visual experience is important. Essentially, ray tracing is a powerful tool for making digital images look just like what we would see in the real world.
