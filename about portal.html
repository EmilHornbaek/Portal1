		<i>Portal</i> is a first-person puzzle game set in a mysterious research facility called <i>Aperture Science</i>. You play as a character named Chell, who wakes up in an unfamiliar, sterile environment with no clear explanation of how you got there. As you explore the facility, you discover a series of increasingly complex test chambers. Thes chambers are designed to challenge your ability to solve puzzles, and the only tool at your disposal is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which is a gun that creates two linked portals on surfaces.
			<br><br>
		The goal in each test chamber is to use the portals to navigate obstacles, manipulate the environment, and reach the exit. As you progress, you start to uncover strange messages and hints that suggest something deeper is going on in the facility. Throughout this, youâ€™re guided (and often taunted) by <i>GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System)</i>, the facility's artificial intelligence. Her voice is calm, but a sinister edge grows in her tone, as you progress through the game's different chambers. While she provides instructions on how to solve puzzles, she also delivers cryptic, passive-aggressive remarks that hint at darker motives. 
			<br>
		Make your way throuh <i>Aperture Science's</i> laboratories, and help Chell on her journey through these test chambers, as she tries to understand what's happening, while <i>GLaDOS'</i> true intentions remain unclear.

		As you progress through the different chambers of the <i>Aperture Science</i> Laboratories the puzzles you are presented with will become more and more challenging and require you to think outside of the (orange) box. Use your knowledge of real life phenomena - such as the use of gravity and momentum - to overcome the obstacles you are presented with, as your mind and body are put to the ultimate test.
		<br><br>
		<i>Portal</i> is a game that is both eerie and darkly humorous, with a sense of isolation and intrigue that keeps you hooked from start to finish. It is up to YOU to decide if you want to take <i>GLaDOS</i> at face value, or dig deeper into this seemingly harmless artificial intelligence's tests and games.
